            We can see that each colored block represents a part of your night.
            They are ordered from bed time to out of bed timestamps you’ve
            written in your journal. Each color is associated with a specific
            sleep stage. You went to bed at 12:22 am and you got out of bed at
            9:47 am, which adds up to 9 hours and 25 minutes of time spent in
            bed. Of this total time, you spent 7 hours and 27 minutes actually
            sleeping. You first fell asleep at XX:XX, to which we will refer to
            as sleep onset. The last non wake block ended at XX:XX, which can
            also be referred to as sleep offset. During that night's sleep, you
            went through each of the 5 five stages. Let's try to see a little
            better what happened about each of them.

            Wake stage is of course the stage we want to minimize when in bed.
            It can be decomposed into two parts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              {" "}
              Sleep latency : Time spent before falling asleep, which
              corresponds to X minutes in your case.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              {" "}
              Wake after sleep onset (WASO): Time spent awake after first
              falling asleep and before waking up.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              {" "}
              For healthy adults, it is normal to experience small awakenings
              during the night. Unprovoked awakenings are mostly during or after
              REM stages.{" "}

            <strong>REM stage</strong> stands for “Rapid Eyes Movements” and is
            also known as “paradoxical sleep”. It is associated with dreaming
            and, as the National Sleep Foundation says,{" "}
            <strong>“the brain is awake and body paralyzed.”</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>N1 stage</strong> is associated with that drowsy feeling
            before falling asleep. Most people wouldn’t say they fell asleep if
            they’ve been woken up from N1 sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>N2 stage</strong> still corresponds to a light sleep, but
            where the muscle activity decreases more, and the eyes have stopped
            moving. It is called, along with N1, <strong>light sleep</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>N3 stage</strong> is when you are deeply asleep, hence it’s
            also called <strong>deep sleep</strong>, or sometimes{" "}
            <strong>slow wave</strong> sleep, and is the most difficult to wake
            up from. It is during those stages that your cells get repaired, and
            that tissue grows. But how much time did you spend in each stage
            during the whole night?

            From here, we can look at your sleep efficiency, which is the
            proportion of time spent asleep over the overall time spent in bed.
            In your case, it corresponds to 79%, or 7h27.

            We are currently looking at your in bed sleep stage proportions.
            Wake time may be overrepresented, because it includes your sleep
            latency and the time you spent in bed after waking up. In order to
            look at your actual stage proportions, we must cut them out from
            wake time to only keep WASO.

            We can see that the most prominent sleep stage is N2, which in your
            case corresponds to XXXX. How does your night compare to other
            people’s night?

            As a rule of thumb, adults approximately stay 5% of their total
            sleep time in N1; 50% in N2; and 20% is in N3. The remaining 25% is
            REM stage sleep.
