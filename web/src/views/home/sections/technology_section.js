        Our sleep stage classification algorithm is trained on the Physionet Sleep-EDF Extended dataset which provides
        153 nights of polysomnographic recordings. The used machine learning approach achieves a 87% accuracy when
        comparing our algorithm to the scoring of a professional electrophysiologist on a night we recorded using a
        Cyton board. Meanwhile, we observe that the agreement rate between professional manual scorers is 82,6%
        [Rosenberg and Van Hout, 2013]. On the other hand, we can see that state of the art automatic sleep scoring
        algorithms can achieve an accuracy as high as 93% [Fiorillo et al., 2019]. By using brainwaves data, it allows
        us to reach higher precision and accuracy than actigraphy based solutions, usually found in some sleep apps.
