              This is your biological clock. It is a self-sustained internal process responsible for regulating your
              sleep and wake cycles every 24 hours as well as other biological processes such as blood pressure, body
              temperature and heart activity. This is why you feel sleepy at night and awake during the day. Some habits
              or events may have an influence on these rhythms. Sleep cycles then take place in these broader processes.

              Sleep homeostasis is a biological regulatory process that rules over how much sleep time and intensity you
              need to get. It is tightly coupled with the <q>sleep debt</q> concept as the more you are awake, the more
              and the deeper you'll need to eventually sleep. The adenosine cycle is suspected to be one of the
              responsible for this. When you are awake, the level of adenosine continuously increases in the brain. When
              we sleep, it is the opposite, it continuously falls. This is why coffee makes us feel more energized, as caffeine acts as an adenosine-receptor antagonist [O. Bj√∂rklund et al., 2008].
