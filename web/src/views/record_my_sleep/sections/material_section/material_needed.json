Medical tape is optional, but helpful for holding certain electrodes on the skin which could come off. If you don't already have this, you can find it all at the drugstore for cheap.",

This can seem a little bit expensive, but it is really useful to keep the electrodes in place for a very long time such as a whole night even if you move a lot. While we recommend it, you can also use medical tape to apply replace the Hepafix, but it is less suitable for long term recordings like sleep study. Pieces of gauze wrap (or gauze pads) will be used to receive the conductive paste and to isolate it. You will also get this at the drugstore.",

You may find it online from different medical equipment distributors.",

EC2 , because it sticks the electrodes really well to your skin, even when applied through hair. It can also be easily washed off afterwards. Ten20 can be a viable solution if you can manage to keep your electrodes in place for the whole night (via medical tape and/or a headband). You can also use both at the same time.",
