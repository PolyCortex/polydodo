      "text": "Rubbing alcohol is important for disinfecting the skin. Cotton swabs will be used to apply different products to the skin. Medical tape is optional, but helpful to hold certain electrodes on the skin which could come off. If you don't already have these, you can find them all at the drugstore for cheap.",

      "text": "Hypafix is a skin adhesive that holds very well in place while being stretchy and comfortable. This can seem a little bit expensive, but it is really useful to keep the electrodes in place for the long term such as a whole night. While we recommend it, you can also use medical tape to replace the Hypafix, but it is less suitable for long term recordings like sleep study. You will also need pieces of gauze wrap (or gauze pads) to receive and  to isolate the conductive paste. You will be able to get Hypafix from medical equipment distributors and gauze wrap can be found at your local drugstore.",

      "text": "Skin prep gel gets rid of dead skin and other impurities when applied to skin. It lowers the connection's impedance and increases conductivity. Concretly, it helps a lot to reduce the signal's noise. We are using NuPrep Skin Gel Prep, but like we already mentionned, multiple equivalent brands are available. You may find it online from different medical equipment distributors.",

      "text": "Conductive paste is an essential part of the montage, because it ensures a good electrical contact between the skin and the electrodes. EC2 is a special conductive paste because it is also a very good adhesive. It comes really handy when applying electrodes to the scalp. Indeed, it holds the electrodes in place all night, even with thick hair, and can be washed off easily afterwards. Ten20 is used for its excellent conductive properties. You can easily find them online along with their equivalent brands.",

      "text": "OpenBCI boards are low-cost brain-computer interface hardware that provides high quality biosignals. Weâ€™re using two channels and a driven ground to record the EEG activity while sleeping. Polydodo is compatible with both Cyton and Ganglion boards. To use them, you will also need the OpenBCI GUI to configure and monitor your recordings. Goldcup electrodes works great for sleep EEG recording and are easy to find. You can find the boards and the electrode on the official OpenBCI store. You'll also need 4 full-charged AA batteries to power the board for the whole night.",

      "text": "If you have a Cyton board, you will probably want to use a SD card. It makes recordings more convenient because it removes the need to maintain the connection between your board and your computer. If you choose to use one, please note that Cyton boards do not work with every kind of microSD card. We can only approve the one we tested: SanDisk Ultra 32Gb class 10 and Kingston SDHC 8Gb class 4. Some other brands we tested were not compatible at all like the Lexar 633x 32gb class 10. Refer to the OpenBCI SD card documentation for more information. That's why we recommend to stick to these.",

Also, electrode wires can be very short, and thus it makes it useful to secure the board near your chest. We used a camera bag and a fanny pack, but any small bag will do.",
