                Start by measuring the impedance between your active electrode and its reference (e.g.: Fpz and Cz).
                Also, check the impedance between the reference electrodes of each channel (Cz and Oz) and the ground
                electrode (A2). As a rule of thumb, low impedance (10 KOhms) is good and high ones are bad (letâ€™s say
                150 KOhms)."
